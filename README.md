## Goals of the Project

The HTML & CSS: Final Module Project has an index.html file that is my personal landing page. The design was translated from https://www.figma.com/design/MD4RVdx3HNvcNdGl8b3AKr/%F0%9F%8E%A8-Personal-Portfolio-Template--Community-?node-id=216-14&t=1pBVMBhuIMzXp1ZB-0.

I have rebranded the design as my own personal landing page.

## What I did

1. Analyze the Design: Look at layout, colors, typography, and components.
2. Rebrand it: Replace placeholders with your own content — text, images, and personal details.
3. Convert to Code: Use HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript to build the page.
4. Showcase Your Skills: Make it clean, responsive, and visually appealing.
5. In response to #4, I did implement the hamburger menu. I also implemented the wrapping of the flex objects. In particular, when shrunk, my profile picture wraps to the top of the text.
